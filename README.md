The datasets contain transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

I have implemented K-Means SMOTE with ANN to classify the fraudulent tarnsactions with an f1-score of 0.79. 

You will find attached the code implemented to achieve the target above along with a poster presentation presented to Prof. Laurent Charlin at HEC Montreal and a summarized report on findings and conclusions was submitted as well.
